<p>My name is Timon Dohnke and I study Computer Science. At the age of 14 I started programming Android apps in Java.</p>

<p>With the learned knowledge I developed an Android App, which informs me in case of a canceled lesson at my school. Furthermore I programmed a small screen for the Raspberry Pi 3 in Python, which is linked to different Apis (e.g. Spotify, Todoist, Toggl, Weather). I also added radio station support to the open source music player "Clay" and continue to work on other open source projects.</p>

<p>Another interest of mine is machine learning. For example, I used the CNN model "YOLO" to recognize characters in video games. Finally, I'm also passionate about IT security.</p>
